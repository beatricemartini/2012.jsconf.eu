# {{ page.title }}

On Sunday July 1st, 2012, 17:00 CEST is our final regular ticket sale (We may sell a couple super-late tickets close to the conference when we have a better picture how many people are coming over all, but don't count on it).

Ticket sales are through Amiando. The price per ticket is 549â‚¬ + Fees + VAT.
JSConf EU is not for profit and all staff including the organizers are volunteers.
Every single penny goes into making the conference more awesome.
We expect to sell out quickly.

Do you trust us?
