Javascript is ubiquitous, but can it solve real though problems? The [traveling saleman problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is a notoriously hard problem to do efficiently (I.e nobody knows how). In this talk we combine art and craft and put JavaScript to the test. We will let JavaScript solve a TSP problem which results in a rendition of the [Mona Lisa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa "Wikipedia on Mona Lisa").
