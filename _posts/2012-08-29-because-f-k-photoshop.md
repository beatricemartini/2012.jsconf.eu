Speaker: <a href="http://julieannhorvath.com/">Julie Ann Horvath</a>

I've seen the future, and it's not in that layered .psd your designer just handed you. As designers and developers, we build things. And we do it often. But we don't build websites or apps. We build systems. Systems that evolve and grow with a company, its users, and both of their needs. The way we design and build these systems should reflect the living, breathing things we want to create and leave more room for them to grow. The question is how do we accomplish this with static assets?

The answer is we set them all on fire. And start in the future. We start in the browser.
