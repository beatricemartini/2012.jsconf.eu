Now that JavaScriptCore is as fast as V8 on its own benchmark, it's well past time to take a look inside JSC's optimizing compiler, the DFG JIT.

In this talk we'll take a look at how the DFG works, what kind of code it does well on, and where it's going.  This is a talk for folks that like bits and compilers, but also for people interested in another engine for high-performance JavaScript.
