Speaker: <a href="http://maryrosecook.com">Mary Rose Cook</a>

A child starts learning to read and write at age 5.  Why can't they start learning to program then, too? I am making Isla, a first programming language for young children. The accompanying environment is called Storytime and lets a child use Isla to write text adventures.

I'll describe the Isla compiler and how I implemented the lexer, parser and interpreter.  I'll describe the design of the Isla grammar.  Why is there no punctuation?  Why are expressions like sentences?  How did I enable array and object assignments, function calls, conditionals and logical rules in baby talk?
