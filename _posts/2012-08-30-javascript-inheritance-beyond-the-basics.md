After giving a brief overview of JavaScript inheritance basics, this talk delves into advanced topics and answers questions such as the following ones:

- What is the difference between constructor inheritance and instance inheritance?
- What is the property `constructor` about?
- How does the `instanceof` operator really work?
- How does one reference a super-property in JavaScript?
- What is the `__proto__` property? Does it have a future?
- Will JavaScript ever have classes? How would they work?
- How do I implement a type via an object instead of via a constructor function?
