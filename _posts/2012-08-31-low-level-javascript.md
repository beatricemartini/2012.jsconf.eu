Low Level JavaScript (LLJS) is an experimental language that lets you write memory-efficient and GC pause-free code less painfully. The research goal here is to explore low-level statically typed features in a high-level dynamically typed language. It can achieve predictable performance. It can make writing code that interfaces with WebGL almost pleasant. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
