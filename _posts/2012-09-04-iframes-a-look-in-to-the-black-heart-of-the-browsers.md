Black magic, voodoo and David Blaine have nothing on iframes. iframes, for better or worse are used all over the web for all manor of dark arts.  They're capable of protecting your site from other people's content, and equally capable of creating public APIs out of thin air.

Through developing JS Bin over the last 4 years, Remy has come to be very intimate with the iframe and it's tricksey ways. This talk will share stories, tricks and upcoming new features of iframes.

iframes: sexy they are not. Freaky: they are!
