Expanding on the topic of my NodeConf 2012 presentation; I discuss the processes involved in prototyping black box devices with Javascript, Node.js, Beagleboards & Arduinos. We cover the basics of getting started with prototyping & development, and illustrate real-world applications. There will even be an interactive demo to keep things interesting. :)
