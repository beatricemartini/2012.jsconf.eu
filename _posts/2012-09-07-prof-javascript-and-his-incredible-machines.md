Hi, IÂ´am Prof. JavaScript.
I work in my hidden laboratory on incredible machines that will help us improve our lives standards. I aim to be the first scientist in the world, who builds a JavaScript powered Rube Goldberg machine for making breakfast eggs.

My earlier inventions are "The unbelievable cat play-o-matic" & "The retrotirized Video-Tweet-Phone-Reader".
In this talk, i will reveal my newest inventions and share their secret blueprints with the audience.
