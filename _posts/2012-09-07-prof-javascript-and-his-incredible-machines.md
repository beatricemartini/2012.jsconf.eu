Speaker: <a href="http://asciidisco.com">Sebastian Golasch</a>

Hi, I am Prof. JavaScript.

I work in my hidden laboratory on incredible machines that will help us improve our living standard. I aim to be the first scientist in the world who builds a JavaScript-powered Rube Goldberg machine for making breakfast eggs. My earlier inventions are "The unbelievable cat play-o-matic" and "The retrotirized Video-Tweet-Phone-Reader".

In this talk, I will reveal my newest inventions and share their secret blueprints with the audience.
