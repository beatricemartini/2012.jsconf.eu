**Imagine a world where your phone, TV and computer could all communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat to your web application. That's the vision of WebRTC.**

WebRTC implements open standards for real-time, plugin-free video, audio and data communication.

As Brendan Eich put it: "WebRTC is a new front in the long war for an open and unencumbered web." We believe WebRTC can democratise and decentralise tools for content creation and communication â€“ for telephony, gaming, video production, music making, news gathering and many other applications.

In this session show you how to use WebRTC to build real-time communication into your web apps:
- what are MediaStream, PeerConnection and DataChannel?
- how does WebRTC signalling work?
- what are ICE, TURN and STUN?
- what do I need server-side for WebRTC?
