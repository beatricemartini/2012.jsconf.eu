We need your help!

There are three events around JSConf EU that are dear to our heart, but that we don’t have the time to organise ourselves this year.

This is where you come in. Help us set up one or more of these events and in return, we’ll give you a full ticket to JSConf EU this year and our eternal gratitude.

The events are the *Pre Party* on Friday 5th, the *After Party* on Sunday 7th and the *Relax.js* brunch on Monday 8th.

For each event you’ll get:

 * A Budget.
 * Full Responsiblity.
 * The job to make it awesome.
 * Our trust that you can do it.

In return, again, you get a free ticket to JSConf EU! :)

## Details

For the *Pre Party*:

 - Friday, October 5th.
 - Near Kastanienallee / GLS Language School / After [NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com).
  - Prater would work, but that’s where we will be for Thursday’s party already :)

For the *After Party*:

 - Sunday, October 7th, from ~19:30.
 - Near the [conference venue](http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/07/01/the-location.html)

For both: we prefer places that are open to the public that we can just crash with the posse.

For the *Relax.js* brunch:

 - Monday, October 8th, ~10:00-15:00.
 - Somewhere nice, chill.
 - Food buffet.
 - Allows people to come and go and hang out before going to the airport/train/way home.
  - i.e. near public transport, ideally U- & S-Bahn.
