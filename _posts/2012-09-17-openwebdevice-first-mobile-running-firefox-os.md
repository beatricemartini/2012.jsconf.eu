OpenWebDevice is the first phone that will be launch running the glamorous project Boot to Gecko (B2G) from Mozilla.

Also recently named Firefox OS, this phone is build based on a linux kernel with lots of goodies coming from Mozilla like the gecko engine, and a whole new system based in html, javascript and css.

With the leitmotiv 'the web is the platform', this new phone will try to change the p web, making it native to the phone!
