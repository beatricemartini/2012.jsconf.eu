Discover how to create shorter simpler programs by modeling them as a circuit of intercommunicating processes.

Modern web applications and libraries have to maintain state, coordinate asynchronous events, and recover from failure. Over the course of development, the complexity of a program's control flow graph can vary greatly from one program to another; in a disorganized program, complexity can quickly grow making the program brittle and difficult to maintain. Inspired by category theory, point-free, and functional reactive programming, this talk will present some ideas on how to describe a program as a circuit, and why it could help to minimize complexity over the program's development.
