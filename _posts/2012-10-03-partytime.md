Conferences are about people. Speakers, attendees and what they make of time spent together. At JSConf EU, we think a bit bigger. Many people travel to Berlin to attend, but not everybody from Berlin can be at the conference.

That’s why we are, like every year, opening our conference parties to the general public. Drinks are on us (until the tab runs out :).

We are inviting the Berlin tech community (that is *you*) and their friends to hang out with everybody that is in town for JSConf EU.

The main party is on Saturday, October 7th, 20:30, if you have to make your pick, this is the one to attend.

If Saturday doesn’t work for you, we are also meeting on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.

Since we do this for you, make sure to [follow our code of conduct](http://2012.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct.html) for all attendees, so everybody can have a good time.
