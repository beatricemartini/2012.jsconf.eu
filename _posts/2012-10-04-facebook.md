Facebook is a social utility whose mission is to make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to keep up with friends, upload an unlimited number of photos, post links and videos, and learn more about the people they meet.  With a user base of over a billion active users, Facebook is pushing the boundaries of client-side technologies and is proud to be a sponsor of JSConf EU.
