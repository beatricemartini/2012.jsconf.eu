As JSConf EU 2011 was a huge success for Kendo UI, we are happy to be
part of the event again this year.

Building a great product means connecting and listening to our
customers. The feedback we get, has a tremendous impact on our
success. Thatâ€™s why is so important for the Kendo UI team to be
committed and connected to the developers. We love getting their
feedback.

JSConf EU is an excellent opportunity for us talking to them, receiving
their feedback how to make Kendo UI better and showing our progress.
