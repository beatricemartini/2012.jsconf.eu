Usually, when you make changes to code you need to imagine what this
code will do, how your components will look like and how colors fit.
But youâ€™ve got a computer for that!

I will show you how immediate feedback on your changes to JavaScript,
HTML or CSS code helps to be more productive, inspire yourself and
catch new ideas. In my opinion, this is definitely going to be the
next best practice in Web development.
